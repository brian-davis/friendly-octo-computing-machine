# TODOS

- improve safety of Producer.where_full_name

- filter/index unread books (0 reading sessions/minutes)
- book wishlist (not bought yet), with "move to collection" button once purchased, date of purchase column
- year_of_birth, not birth_year
- series title, like "The Adventures of Tintin"

- home server with dynamic dns, follow tutorial

- more citations (all formats)

- prevent duplicate subform lines (e.g. select_producer same author twice to work)

- flex style on subform
- extraneous link on publisher show view

- find-or-create on attributes building
