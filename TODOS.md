# TODOS

- improve safety of Producer.where_full_name

- filter/index unread books (0 reading sessions/minutes)

- book wishlist (not bought yet), with "move to collection" button once purchased, date of purchase column

- flex style on subform

- home server with dynamic dns, follow tutorial

- more citations (all formats)

- prevent duplicate subform lines (e.g. select_producer same author twice to work)

- extraneous link on publisher show view

- year_of_birth, not birth_year

- debug odd ordering by year on Work index

- find-or-create on attributes building

- series title, like "The Adventures of Tintin"
